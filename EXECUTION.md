# EXECUTION.md — Choir Part Tracker Build Plan

This breaks `PRD.md` into milestones. **One milestone per session.** Each milestone ends with the `milestone-report` skill's fixed summary, and the agent stops and waits for explicit approval before starting the next one — see `RULES.md`.

Do not skip ahead. Do not combine milestones "to save time." A milestone that hasn't been through its verification skill is not done, regardless of how confident the implementation looks.

---

## Milestone 0 — Workspace Scaffold
**PRD refs:** §4.1, §9.1–§9.3
**Goal:** Nx workspace exists with both apps and both shared libs generated and wired together.
**Do:**
- `npx create-nx-workspace@latest choir-workspace --preset=apps`
- Generate `choir-api` (Express) and `choir-client` (Next.js).
- Generate `libs/shared/types` and `libs/shared/validation`.
**Verify with:** `nx-workspace-verify`
**Done when:** `nx show projects` lists all four projects; a trivial import from `libs/shared/validation` works in both apps.

---

## Milestone 1 — Shared Contracts
**PRD refs:** §6
**Goal:** All Zod schemas and enums from §6 exist in `libs/shared/validation`, nowhere else.
**Do:** Implement `VoicePartTypeEnum`, `SongStatusEnum`, `SongComplexityEnum`, `LinkPlatformEnum`, `UserRoleEnum`, `CreateSongSchema`, `CreateSongPartSchema`, `CreateSongLinkSchema`, `UpdateSongSchema`, `UpdateSongPartSchema`, `LoginSchema`, and their inferred DTO types.
**Verify with:** `nx-workspace-verify` (schema-drift grep step)
**Done when:** every schema in §6 exists exactly once, and both apps can import from the shared lib without error.

---

## Milestone 2 — Database Layer
**PRD refs:** §5, §8.1
**Goal:** Prisma schema matches §5 exactly; first migration applied to a dev database.
**Do:** Write `schema.prisma` (User, Song, SongPart, SongLink, all enums); set up Supabase dev project; create the first migration.
**Verify with:** `prisma-create-migration` for the migration itself; keep `prisma-safe-reset` on hand but do not run it unless something breaks and you explicitly ask for it.
**Done when:** migration applied cleanly; `npx prisma studio` (or equivalent) shows the expected tables.

---

## Milestone 3 — Auth
**PRD refs:** §2, §4.2, §7 (auth row), §9.6
**Goal:** `POST /api/v1/auth/login` works; `requireAuth` and `requireRole` middleware exist; the Section-Leader-scoped check for voice parts is implemented.
**Do:** Password hashing (bcrypt), JWT issuance/verification, the two middleware functions, seed one Director user for testing.
**Verify with:** `api-endpoint-scaffold` while building it, then `auth-guard-verify` — the full role matrix must be run before this milestone is called done, not just the login endpoint itself.
**Done when:** the `auth-guard-verify` matrix is complete with no unresolved mismatches.

---

## Milestone 4 — Core API (Songs, Parts, Links)
**PRD refs:** §7
**Goal:** Every remaining row in the §7 endpoint table is implemented and guarded correctly.
**Do:** Songs CRUD, parts bulk-upsert and single-part update (with the leadsVoicePart check), links add/remove.
**Verify with:** `api-endpoint-scaffold` per endpoint, `auth-guard-verify` re-run against the full expanded matrix, `docker-build-test` once the module is complete.
**Done when:** every §7 endpoint matches its row exactly and passes the auth matrix.

---

## Milestone 5 — Frontend Foundation
**PRD refs:** §4.1, §4.3
**Goal:** Next.js app has shadcn/ui initialized, Tailwind configured, the `cn()` helper in place, an API client, and TanStack Query hooks for songs.
- [x] **Milestone 5a: Frontend Scaffold & Tooling** (Tailwind + shadcn + one component verification)
- [x] **Milestone 5b: Frontend Data Layer** (api-client.ts/query-keys.ts/use-songs.ts)
**Do:** `shadcn init` + add the component set from §4.3; `lib/utils.ts`, `lib/api-client.ts`, `hooks/use-songs.ts`.
**Verify with:** `shadcn-component-add` (for the initial component set), `nx-workspace-verify`
**Done when:** a bare catalog page can fetch and render the song list from the live API.

---

## Milestone 6 — Frontend Features
**PRD refs:** §3.1–§3.4, §4.3
**Goal:** The full catalog experience — search, S/A/T filter chips, sort (Title / Recently Added / Complexity), add/edit song dialog with react-hook-form + zodResolver, inline part-notes editor scoped to the logged-in user's role, and the links section.
**Do:** Build the components listed in the PRD §4.1 tree under `songs/_components/`.
**Verify with:** `shadcn-component-add` as needed, `frontend-browser-verify` — walk every checklist item in that skill before calling this done.
**Done when:** `frontend-browser-verify`'s checklist passes with no console errors, and the UI's editable/read-only states match each seeded test user's role.

---

## Milestone 7 — Deployment Readiness
**PRD refs:** §8
**Goal:** The app is actually deployable to Render + Vercel on the free tier, per §8, with no placeholder config left in place.
**Do:** Finalize the Dockerfile, set real Render/Vercel env vars, confirm CORS origin matches the real Vercel URL, seed the production Director user.
**Verify with:** `docker-build-test`, `env-config-audit`
**Done when:** both audits pass and a real deploy (or a full local simulation of one) succeeds end to end.
